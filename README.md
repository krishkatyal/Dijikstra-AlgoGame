# Dijkstra Algorithm Game

## What is Dijkstra Algorithm:
- This algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The Dijkstra algorithm begins with a node and checks its neighbours, adding their neighbours to the queue. 


### What does the code do:
In this, You draw grey walls using the left mouse click. This causes the algorithm queue to stop and the queued nodes to go around the barriers.

Use the right mouse click to create a end node represented by yellow.

Below is the code while its running.

Now what happens if there is a surrounding wall around the end node?
